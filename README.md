# nauxscript-alfred-workflow

my alfred workflows repo.

collects some workflows I usually use & made by me.

## workflow self made

1. usualfile.workflow: I always open download folder / user folder and some commonly used folders by alfred `Open` command, and I found that just setup a workflow simplily and would save a lot of time spended on old way.

  - keyword `dl` / hotkey `opt` + `p`: open `Download` folder;
  - keyword `pic` : open `Pictures` folder;
  - keyword `dv` : open `Develop` folder (self use local project folders);
  - keyword `me` : open current user folder (path `~`);
